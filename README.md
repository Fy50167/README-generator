# README Generator

## Description

This application uses the Uniquirer package in order to take user input and generate a professional looking README template that can then be modified afterwards to allow for quick-and-easy creation of professional looking README files.

## Installation

All necessary dependencies (Inquirer) are already installed so simply downloading all assets from the repository should provide all of the necessary files. The application can then be run by running the command node index.

## Usage

The user provides input to all of the Inquirer prompts, and the README is automatically generated based on these. No other steps are required besides moving the README file after it is generated and/or including any additional assets afterwards such as images or links. For a demo of the application, view the video at the following link: [Demo link](https://www.loom.com/share/024223ecee5048eca08d63a93ed30a67?sid=ac80b992-3415-403b-822c-dec63022183d)

## Tests

In order to test full functionality after installation, simply run node index and provides dummy strings for all of the prompts. If the README file is correctly generated then the application is working and the user can then provide correct inputs.
